### What is chaos? 
Essentially in this project I mapped the rate of change of a Lorenz system to the rate of change of the mean frequency of an audio file. In order to limit the rate at which the system was allowed to change, I applied a logistic function to the rate of change of the system. I then used canvas to display the changing coordinates to the screen, and further added some visual effects in the form of lines. 

### Current state of the project 
Since this is my first JavaScript/HTML project, I am still working on making the code modular and adding new features in the form of music and different equations. 

### Current Todo list:
- [ ] Make code more modular 
- [ ] Add Java Docstring
- [ ] Add ability to choose new songs
- [ ] Add ability to manipulate equations 

### Attributions
This project currently uses a royalty free version of Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise.
